Download your blendle purchases

On blendle.com you can purchase online editions of news papers and magazines or just single articles of these.
You can also download these articles as pdf via a web browser. 
This simple library should allow you to do so automatically.

Unfortunately the web rendering and saving as pdf is not working yet, so if you are experienced to Qt 4 or 5 feel free 
to contribute to this project.
